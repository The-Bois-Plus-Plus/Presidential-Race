# Presidential-Race
Developed by Denis Garley, Braden Hansen, Isaac Dunn, and Dalin Craig. 
This is a runner game with three levels. The player plays as Donald Trump and must collect ballots while avoiding or squashing corona-virus pathogens.

# Development enviroment and running the game
We used Visual Studio Code as an editor and ran the game by interpreting the game with python 3.8. The gem can be played simply by running main.py in python.
