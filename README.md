# Presidential-Race
Developed by Denis Garley, Braden Hansen, Isaac Dunn, and Dalin Craig. 
This is a runner game with three levels. The player plays as Donald Trump and must collect ballots while avoiding or squashing corona-virus pathogens.

# Development enviroment and running the game
We used Visual Studio Code as an editor and ran the game by interpreting the game with python 3.8. We used the pygame library to implement it.
The gem can be played simply by running main.py in python.

# Resources
We used the pygame documentation but most things could be understood by reading the code as it's not terribly complicated.
